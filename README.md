Analysis of OpenStreetMap History.

[Latest weekly changesets](http://planet.openstreetmap.org/) on
`planet.openstreetmap.org` includes all changesets for the recorded
history of OpenStreetMap as a 4.2G XML file.

Changesets have:

* uid
* id
* bbox
* num_changes
* date_opened
* date_closed

This code is inspired by [ChangesetMD](https://github.com/ToeBee/ChangesetMD),
with a few differences:

* SQLite instead of Postgres
* expat instead of sax.handler
* more compact schema for smaller databases
* BSD instead of GPL

Initialize an SQLite file:

    cat schema.sql | sqlite3 changesets.sqlite

Import a changeset dump into sqlite:

    python stm.py changesets-latest.osm[.bz2] changesets.sqlite

 Indexes

     create index uid_idx on osm_changeset (user_id);

## Graphs

These guys you can generate with scripts but are too heavy to put on gist.

When users register versus how likely they are to contribute for more than
a year. Nearly all of the early users of OpenStreetMap contributed more
than a year, while users who started contributing 2 years ago are much
less likely.

User lives histogram. Of course, the vast majority of users last less than
two days. It's an exponential distribution from there on with no clear peaks.
